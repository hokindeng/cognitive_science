Vision Language Model Cognitive Experiments
This repository contains cognitive experiments designed to evaluate Vision Language Models (VLMs) on three cognitive tasks:

Mechanical Reasoning
Perspective-Taking
Law of Conservation
Each cognitive task is organized into its own directory, containing a series of experiments labeled sequentially.

Experiment Structure
Each experiment follows the same structure:

question.txt: Contains the question posed to the VLM.
correct_answer.txt: Contains the expected correct answer.
media/: A folder containing all necessary media files for the experiment, labeled numerically (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
Cognitive Tasks
Mechanical Reasoning
Experiments designed to test the VLM's ability to understand and reason about mechanical systems and physical interactions.

Perspective-Taking
Experiments that assess the VLM's capacity to adopt different viewpoints or understand situations from another's perspective.

Law of Conservation
Experiments focusing on the VLM's understanding of conservation principles, such as mass, volume, and number conservation.

How to Use
Navigate to the desired cognitive task directory (e.g., Mechanical_Reasoning).
Select an experiment folder (e.g., Experiment_1).
Read the question.txt file to understand the task.
Review the media files in the media/ folder as necessary for the experiment.
Compare the VLM's output to the correct_answer.txt to evaluate performance.
Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please ensure that any new experiments adhere to the existing structure:

Include both question.txt and correct_answer.txt files.
Store all media files in a media/ folder, labeled with sequential numbers.
